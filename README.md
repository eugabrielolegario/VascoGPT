# VascoGPT Project

**VascoGPT** is an AI project developed in Python, implemented as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). It was created to simulate Vasco (VAS-119), a space research assistant robot from an organization called Constellation, in the game Starfield by Bethesda Game Studios. This project utilizes the OpenAI ChatGPT API to create an interactive and engaging experience with the character Vasco.

## Objectives

The main objectives of the VascoGPT project include:

1. **Interaction with Vasco:** Allow players to interact with the character Vasco from Starfield through text commands.

2. **Personality Simulation:** Develop a captivating and unique personality for Vasco that is consistent with his portrayal in the game.

3. **Contextual Responses:** Empower Vasco to provide contextually relevant and engaging responses to player questions.

4. **Space Research:** Provide information and insights about Constellation and the space missions that take place in the Starfield universe.

5. **OpenAI API Integration:** Utilize the OpenAI ChatGPT API to enhance conversational capabilities and make interactions with Vasco more dynamic.

## Technologies Used

The VascoGPT project uses:

- **Python:** The primary programming language for project development.

- **Jupyter Notebook:** The platform used to create and run the VascoGPT code.

- **OpenAI GPT-3.5:** The OpenAI API is at the core of Vasco's conversational ability, enabling intelligent and contextual responses.

## Getting Started

To use the VascoGPT project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning the VascoGPT GitHub repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eugabrielolegario/VascoGPT.git
    ```

2. **Set Up OpenAI API:** Obtain an API key from OpenAI and set it as an environment variable in a `.env` file in the project directory. You can find information on how to obtain an API key from the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/).

    Example `.env` file:
    
    ```plaintext
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Project:** Run the Jupyter Notebook file `VascoGPT.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook VascoGPT.ipynb
    ```

    Follow the instructions within the notebook to interact with Vasco.

## Usage

In the Jupyter Notebook, you can interact with Vasco by running the provided code cells. Vasco will respond to your text inputs based on his personality and the context provided.
