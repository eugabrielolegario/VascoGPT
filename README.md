## Objectives

The main objectives of the VascoGPT project include:

1. **Interaction with Vasco:** Allow players to interact with the character Vasco from Starfield through text commands.

2. **Personality Simulation:** Develop a captivating and unique personality for Vasco that is consistent with his portrayal in the game.

3. **Contextual Responses:** Empower Vasco to provide contextually relevant and engaging responses to player questions.

4. **Space Research:** Provide information and insights about Constellation and the space missions that take place in the Starfield universe.

5. **OpenAI API Integration:** Utilize the OpenAI ChatGPT API to enhance conversational capabilities and make interactions with Vasco more dynamic.

## Technologies Used

The VascoGPT project uses:

- **Python:** The primary programming language for project development.

- **Jupyter Notebook:** The platform used to create and run the VascoGPT code.

- **OpenAI GPT-3.5:** The OpenAI API is at the core of Vasco's conversational ability, enabling intelligent and contextual responses.
